   - Execute JavaScript commands in real-time.
   - View messages and errors that occur on the webpage.

3. **Network:**
   - Monitor network requests made by the webpage.
   - Inspect headers, response times, and payloads of requests.

4. **Performance:**
   - Analyze the performance of a webpage.
   - Identify slow-running scripts and rendering issues.

5. **Application:**
   - Inspect and manage storage, including cookies, local storage, and session storage.
   - View resources like images and fonts used by the webpage.

6. **Security:**
   - View the security details of a webpage.
   - Check for issues with HTTPS and certificate validity.

7. **Device Mode:**
