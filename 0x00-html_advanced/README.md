#	Advanced HTML

Advanced HTML involves using a combination of HTML5 features, semantic elements, APIs, and modern web development practices to create rich, interactive, and accessible web content. Here are some key components:

##	1. HTML5 Semantic Elements

    Sectioning Elements: <section>, <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <header>, <footer>.
    Text-Level Semantics: <mark>, <time>, <progress>, <output>, <meter>, <data>, <bdi>.


##	2. Canvas and SVG

    Canvas API: <canvas> element for drawing graphics on the fly via JavaScript.
    SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): <svg> element for defining vector-based graphics that can scale and be manipulated.


##	3. Media Elements

    Audio and Video: <audio> and <video> elements for embedding media files with native controls.
    Track Element: <track> for adding subtitles, captions, and other text tracks to media.


##	4. APIs and Interactive Features

    Geolocation API: To get the geographical position of a user.
    Web Storage API: localStorage and sessionStorage for storing data on the client side.
    Web Workers: For running scripts in background threads to enhance performance.
    Service Workers: For creating offline-first web applications.
    WebSockets: For real-time communication.


##	5. Forms and Input Types

    New Input Types: date, email, url, number, range, color, etc.
    Form Attributes: autocomplete, novalidate, required, pattern.


##	6. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

    ARIA Roles and Attributes: Enhance accessibility for users with disabilities by providing additional context to HTML elements.


##	7. Microdata and Metadata

    Microdata: itemscope, itemtype, itemprop attributes for embedding machine-readable data.
    Metadata: <meta> tags for defining character sets, viewport settings, and other metadata.


##	8. Best Practices

    Progressive Enhancement: Building a basic version first and adding advanced features later.
    Responsive Design: Using <meta name="viewport">, media queries, and flexible grid layouts.
    SEO: Proper use of semantic tags, meta descriptions, and headings to improve search engine visibility.

Advanced HTML also implies a good understanding of CSS and JavaScript to create modern, responsive, and interactive web applications.
